# ShinyLakeWater
Shiny Application Great Lakes Water Quality

Swimming at my Grandfathers cottage on Lake St. Clair; the water was always murky, strangely warm, a bit smelly and unsettling.

Growing up on the shores of Lake Erie; Certain questions were always in the back of my mind. Whats in the water that I'm swimming in? Should we really be catching and eating the fish?

A chemical engineer at one of the local poluters once told me about the pools of mercury settled at the bottom of the lower lakes. 

Zug island, River Rouge, Toledo, Hamilton, Windsor supporting the modern age without any regard for the natural world.

Fast forward to current version of adulthood searching for closure, I decided to clean a large dataset and create a shiny app.

The data was obtained from the [https://www.canada.ca/en/services/science/open-data.html](Government of Canada Open Data Portal).
